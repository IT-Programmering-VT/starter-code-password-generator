### Starting code for Thursdays lesson where we will learn about DOM and events

During Thursdays lesson we are going to create a password generator while learning how to manipulate the DOM. You can clone this repository to get the finished html and css files if you don't want to code it. I will code it during the lesson but only this time. After this i will always provide the html and css and I won't code it during class so we get to focus on JavaScript.
